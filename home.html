    <p>Province of sulu

       A landmark born of the social process was the founding of the Sultanate of Sulu. Year 1380 CE, The Sunni Sufi Scholar Karim-ul Makhdum came to Sulu and introduced Islam to the Philippines. In 1450 CE, Johore-born Arab adventurer Sayyid Abubakar Abirin came to Sulu and lived with Rajah Baguinda Ali. The Sunni Sufi Teacher and Sayyid Abubakar eventually married Ali's daughter, Dayang-dayang Paramisuli, and inherited Rajah Baguinda's polity (which was a principality before), which he turned into the Sultanate of Sulu and become its first Sultan. To consolidate his rule, Sayyid Abubakar united the local political units under the umbrella of the Sultanate. A Sultanate that followed the Ash'ari Aqeeda, Shafi'i Madh'hab and Sufism. He brought Sulu, Zamboanga Peninsula, Palawan, and Basilan under its aegis..</p>

    <h2><mark>GEOGRAPHY</mark></h2>
    <p>Sulu Archipelago, archipelago comprising hundreds of volcanic and coral islands and numerous rocks and reefs in the southwestern Philippines. A double island chain, it extends 170 miles (270 km) southwest from Basilan island off southwestern Mindanao and ends near the eastern shores of Sabah (East Malaysia). The islands, the most important of which are Jolo, Tawi Tawi, Sanga-Sanga, Sibutu, Siasi, and Cagayan Sulu, form a rampart between the Sulu (northwest) and Celebes (southeast) seas. The islands are thickly forested, and their fertile soils support some rice, cassava, coconuts, and fruit. Marine-based activities, however, are the economic mainstay.</p>

    <h2><mark>DEMOGRAPHICS</mark></h2>
    <p>As of the latest available data, Abra has a diverse population primarily composed of indigenous peoples belonging to various ethnic groups such as the Tingguians, Ilocanos, and Kankanaeys. The province has a relatively small population compared to other provinces in the Philippines, with a majority residing in rural areas engaged in agriculture, particularly rice farming. Abra has a youthful population, with a significant portion being under the age of 30, and the province experiences a relatively high birth rate compared to the national average. However, like many rural areas in the Philippines, Abra faces challenges such as outmigration, particularly among young adults seeking better economic opportunities in urban centers or abroad.</p>
